  *Wrong, Wrong, Wrong!* is in the first level of Chinese Breeze which
  contains approximately 300 words.Wrong, Wrong, Wrong!

  Description of the book: June 8. Beijing. A pretty girl lies dead on
  the floor of her luxury home. A slip of paper found on her body
  reads, “I am tired. Let me leave…” At the bottom of the slip is a
  signature: Lin Shuang- shuang.

  Shuang-shuang has a twin-sister called Dui-dui. The two girls look
  so similar that others can hardly tell who’s who. Is the one who
  died really Shuang-shuang? Then where is Dui-dui? If the one who
  died is Dui-dui as someone claimed, then why is the signature on the
  slip Lin Shuang-shuang?

  This course covers all of the vocabulary in the 9 chapters.
